# Chanales_CurrBio_2017

Here we have made available the scripts used in the analysis of the data and figure generation from [Chanales, Oza, Favila, and Kuhl, Current Biology 2017]. The raw data in BIDS format from the study can be found on OpenNeuro (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000217/versions/00002). Additional data needed to analyze the data including calibration scans and ROI masks can be found on OSF (). Scripts are provided so that readers can see how the data from this study were analyzed; they have not been edited for ease of general use.  

The Matlab scripts require the following dependencies:
1) spm8 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm)
2) the princeton mvpa toolbox (http://www.pni.princeton.edu/mvpa)

To analyze the data perform
